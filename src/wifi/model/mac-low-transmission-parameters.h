/**
 * \brief control how a packet is transmitted.
 * \ingroup wifi
 *
 * The ns3::MacLow::StartTransmission method expects
 * an instance of this class to describe how the packet
 * should be transmitted.
 *
 * For SU PPDUs, call:
 * - EnableAck () if the frame is followed by a Normal Ack;
 *
 * - EnableBlockAck (BlockAckType) if the frame is followed by a Block Ack
 * of the given type;
 *
 * - EnableBlockAckRequest (BlockAckReqType, BlockAckType) if the sender
 * will subsequently transmit a Block Ack Request of the given type, followed
 * by a Block Ack of the given type.
 *
 * For DL MU PPDUs using a sequence of Block Ack Requests/Block Ack responses, call:
 * - EnableAck (address) if the station with the given address will reply with a
 * Normal Ack a SIFS after the transmission of the DL MU PPDU;
 *
 * - EnableBlockAck (address) if the station with the given address will reply with a
 * Block Ack of the given type a SIFS after the transmission of the DL MU PPDU;
 *
 * -EnableBlockAckRequest (address, BlockAckReqType, BlockAckType) if the sender
 * will transmit a Block Ack Request of the given type to the station with the
 * given address, which will reply with a Block Ack of the given type.
 *
 * For DL MU PPDUs using acknowledgment via a separate MU-BAR Trigger Frame, call:
 * - EnableBlockAckRequest (address, BlockAckReqType, BlockAckType) to include a
 * User Info subfield addressed to the station with the given address in the
 * following MU-BAR Trigger Frame.
 *
 * For a MU-BAR Trigger Frame transmitted after a DL MU PPDU, call:
 * - EnableBlockAck (address, BlockAckType) for each of the stations addressed
 * by the MU-BAR Trigger Frame.
 *
 * For a DL MU PPDU with aggregated MU-BAR Trigger Frames, call:
 * - EnableBlockAck (address, BlockAckType) for each of the stations addressed
 * by the DL MU PPDU.
